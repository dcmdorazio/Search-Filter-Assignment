# Search-Filter-Assignment
This is an example for a search filter in HTML, JavaScript and CSS styling.
The project was created and edited in IntelliJ IDEA ULTIMATE IDE!

I was unfortunately unable to get the project done. I was unable to get the resources I needed to get this design to work. It is unsatisfying that I couldn't do it. However, this was my first time with HTML and CSS code so for a start I am glad I learned a little bit from it.
